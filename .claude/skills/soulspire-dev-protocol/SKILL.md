# Soulspire Development Protocol

Read the references below before starting any code/asset work.

## Reference Files

1. **references/git-rules.md** — Pre/post-work checklists, scene conflict prevention
2. **references/prefab-protocol.md** — Prefab vs scene objects, naming, folder structure, scene edit procedures

## Key Rules (3-line summary)

1. Commit immediately after work. Use team-specific `--author` tag (see CLAUDE.md).
2. Minimize direct scene file edits. Prefer prefabs. Only one person edits a scene at a time.
3. Check file ownership before editing. Do not modify another team's folders.
