# Scenario and Narrative Design Reference

## Purpose
Use this document when designing world building, character arcs, quest narratives, branching logic, and storytelling integration with gameplay.

## Scope
- Narrative pillars and tone.
- World bible governance.
- Character motivations and arc checkpoints.
- Quest structure and pacing.
- Environmental storytelling strategy.

## Inputs Required
- Genre expectations and audience maturity level.
- Narrative complexity budget.
- Localization target markets.
- Voice-over budget constraints.
- Core loop integration points.

## Workflow
1. Define narrative promise in one paragraph.
2. Build world bible with immutable lore rules.
3. Create cast sheet with motivation and conflict vectors.
4. Design quest architecture by critical path and optional depth.
5. Map branching points and recombination strategy.
6. Validate ludonarrative consistency against gameplay.

## Narrative Structure Patterns
### Hub and Spoke
Main story hubs with optional side arcs.
Use for controlled pacing and manageable production.

### Branch and Rejoin
Meaningful player choices with later recombination.
Use to preserve agency without exponential content growth.

### Layered Environmental Narrative
Embed story signals in level composition, props, audio, and encounter logic.
Use to reduce exposition and increase immersion.

## Quest Writing Rules
- Give each quest a clear intent, tension, and consequence.
- Keep objectives action-verifiable, not ambiguous.
- Use character voice consistently in all quest text.
- Avoid lore dumps before player motivation is established.

## Ludonarrative Consistency Checks
- Is hero behavior in gameplay aligned with story characterization?
- Do reward loops undermine story stakes?
- Are fail states narratively coherent?

## Localization and Culturalization
- Avoid jokes dependent on untranslatable wordplay for critical content.
- Flag culturally sensitive references early.
- Maintain glossary for names, factions, and lore terms.

## Deliverables
- Narrative pillar document.
- World bible.
- Character arc map.
- Quest flow diagrams.
- Branching narrative map.
- Localization notes and glossary.

## Practical Checklist
- Can story be understood through gameplay context alone?
- Are player choices reflected in world state or feedback?
- Is narrative pacing aligned with gameplay intensity?
