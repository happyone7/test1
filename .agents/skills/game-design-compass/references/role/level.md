# Level Design Reference

## Purpose
Use this document when planning playable spaces, encounter rhythm, guidance language, pacing control, and readability in mission flow.

## Scope
- Spatial macro flow and micro encounters.
- Player guidance and orientation.
- Combat and traversal rhythm.
- Reward and secret placement.
- Greybox-to-final readability continuity.

## Inputs Required
- Player movement kit and combat range profile.
- Mission objective sequence.
- Enemy taxonomy and encounter budget.
- Session target duration.

## Level Planning Workflow
1. Define mission fantasy and primary verbs.
2. Build macro flow map.
- Start state.
- Midpoint escalation.
- Climax and release.
3. Draft critical path and optional path layers.
4. Place encounter beats and rest beats.
5. Place reward loops and hidden content.
6. Greybox test with traversal timing.
7. Revise for readability and pacing.

## Guidance Toolkit
- Landmark contrast for orientation.
- Lighting and color framing for route emphasis.
- Geometry funneling to reduce dead navigation.
- Audio cues for objective proximity.

## Encounter Pacing Pattern
- Teach: introduce mechanic in low-pressure context.
- Test: combine known mechanics with new pressure.
- Twist: add variation that forces adaptation.
- Mastery: demand execution under compounded stress.

## Secret and Reward Design
- Hide rewards behind curiosity, not random obscurity.
- Reward optional exploration with meaningful value.
- Use visual foreshadowing to hint hidden routes.

## Deliverables
- Level flow diagram.
- Encounter beat sheet.
- Spatial callout map.
- Greybox review notes.
- Readability and navigation checklist.

## Practical Checklist
- Can players recover orientation within 5 seconds after intense combat?
- Is each encounter area supporting intended combat style?
- Are optional paths discoverable without external hints?
- Is traversal downtime intentional and paced?
