# PD / Lead Designer Reference

## Purpose
Use this document when defining game vision, scope, milestone strategy, and cross-discipline execution rules.

## Primary Responsibilities
1. Translate product vision into implementable feature goals.
2. Prioritize features against schedule, budget, and team capability.
3. Maintain design coherence across systems, narrative, level, UI, art, and economy.
4. Own go/no-go decisions at each production gate.

## Inputs Required
- Product thesis in one sentence.
- Target player segments and market positioning.
- Target platforms and technical constraints.
- Revenue model and launch region constraints.
- Team composition and delivery timeline.

## Strategic Planning Workflow
1. Define vision frame.
- Fantasy promise: what emotional fantasy the game must deliver.
- Core loop promise: what repeated action should stay satisfying for 20+ hours.
- Differentiator: why players switch from alternatives.
2. Build scope frame.
- Must-have features for launch.
- High-value optional features.
- Explicitly deferred ideas.
3. Build milestone frame.
- Concept: prove audience and fantasy.
- Vertical slice: prove fun and production quality bar.
- Production alpha: feature complete for core loop.
- Beta: content complete and stability push.
- Release candidate: compliance, performance, and economy lock.
4. Build risk frame.
- Design risk, technical risk, content risk, operational risk.
- Mitigation owner and deadline for each risk.

## GDD Ownership Model
Own a living GDD with the following mandatory sections:
1. Pitch and product goals.
2. Core loop and progression map.
3. Feature specs and success criteria.
4. Economy and monetization strategy.
5. Narrative and world consistency rules.
6. UI/UX standards and accessibility requirements.
7. Art and audio direction principles.
8. Analytics instrumentation plan.
9. Live operations plan.

## Decision Frameworks
### Feature Prioritization Matrix
Score each candidate feature on:
- Player value.
- Business impact.
- Development complexity.
- Technical uncertainty.
- Reusability for future content.

### Cut Strategy (When Schedule Slips)
1. Cut low-impact cosmetic complexity first.
2. Cut feature variants before core feature functionality.
3. Cut launch content breadth before quality floor.
4. Never cut telemetry and error observability.

### Conflict Resolution Rule
When teams disagree, decide in this order:
1. Player readability and fairness.
2. Product goals and monetization integrity.
3. Production risk and maintainability.

## Leadership Deliverables
- Vision brief (1-2 pages).
- Milestone plan with entry/exit criteria.
- Feature priority board.
- Risk register with mitigation status.
- Weekly design health report.
- Pre-launch readiness checklist.

## Practical Checklist
- Is the game goal clear in one sentence?
- Can each feature be validated with a measurable KPI?
- Is the launch scope survivable with current staffing?
- Is there a clear rollback or simplification plan per risky system?
- Is there a written policy for post-launch balance cadence?

## Common Failure Modes
- Vision statement too broad to guide tradeoffs.
- Scope creep disguised as polish.
- Unowned dependencies between design and engineering.
- Missing acceptance criteria for milestone gates.
