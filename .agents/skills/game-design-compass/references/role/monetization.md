## Inputs Required

## Business Model Selection
### Premium (P2P)
Best for complete-value proposition and low live-ops dependency.

### Free-to-Play (F2P)
Best when retention and content cadence are strong enough to sustain lifecycle value.

### Subscription
Best when recurring content and service quality are consistently high.

### Hybrid
Use carefully. Avoid contradictory value messaging.

## Economy Boundaries
1. Define non-negotiable fair-play boundaries.
2. Separate power progression from direct purchase where possible.
3. Prioritize convenience and personalization over pay-to-win pressure.

## Offer Design Framework
- Starter pack: accelerate onboarding without invalidating progression.
- Battle pass: align rewards with core engagement cadence.

- Time-limited offers: use sparingly and transparently.

## Gacha and Randomized Purchase Guardrails
- Publish probability tables clearly.
- Add pity or guarantee mechanics for high-value pulls.
- Prevent exploitative loops targeting vulnerable behavior.

## Ad Integration Rules
- Rewarded ads: opt-in, meaningful rewards, bounded frequency.
- Interstitial ads: avoid interrupting mastery moments.
- Native placement: maintain readability and trust.

## Live Monetization Governance
- Monitor conversion, retention, payer mix, and churn.
- Audit monetization impact on gameplay sentiment.
- Maintain rollback path for harmful monetization experiments.

## Deliverables

## Practical Checklist
