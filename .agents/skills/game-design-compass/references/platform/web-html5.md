# Web and HTML5 Platform Design Reference

## Platform Promise
Design for instant access, fast onboarding, lightweight sessions, and shareable loops that support distribution-driven growth.

## Core Constraints
- Browser performance variance.
- Network variability and asset loading limits.
- Input diversity across mouse, keyboard, and touch.
- Session drop-off risk from loading friction.

## Core Loop and Session Strategy
- Deliver playable state quickly.
- Use short loops that reward immediate replays.
- Build progression depth without heavy startup overhead.

## UX and Interaction Rules
- Keep initial interaction simple and obvious.
- Provide clear controls for both desktop and mobile web contexts.
- Gracefully handle focus loss, tab switching, and pause/resume.

## Loading and Retention Planning
- Prioritize first meaningful interaction over full asset preload.
- Stage content loading behind gameplay milestones.
- Use social sharing hooks tied to achievement moments.

## Monetization Considerations
- Ad-supported models require strict interruption discipline.
- Rewarded interactions should feel optional and fair.
- Avoid intrusive patterns that conflict with platform trust.

## Compatibility Strategy
- Define minimum browser support matrix.
- Plan fallback behavior for unsupported capabilities.
- Validate UI across aspect ratios and viewport scales.

## Deliverables
- Web session and funnel map.
- Loading strategy specification.
- Input adaptation matrix.
- Browser compatibility checklist.
- Viral mechanic planning brief.

## Practical Checklist
- Can players start interacting within a few seconds?
- Is gameplay resilient to tab and connection interruptions?
- Are share loops aligned with genuine achievement moments?
