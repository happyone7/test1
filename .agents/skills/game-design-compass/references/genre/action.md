# Action Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver high-intensity mastery through movement precision, combat readability, and skill-expression loops.

## Core Principles
- 3C quality determines perceived polish.
- Responsiveness is more important than complexity.
- Readability must scale with encounter intensity.

## Core Loop
1. Enter combat challenge.
2. Read telegraphs and react.
3. Execute attack/defense timing.
4. Gain upgrade resources.
5. Unlock advanced movement or combat options.

## Combat System Priorities
- Animation timing windows are design-critical.
- Hit stop, camera impulse, and sound cue alignment drive impact.
- Difficulty should test decision quality, not input buffering failures.

## Difficulty Curve Model
- Early game: teach movement and basic counters.
- Mid game: chain pressure with mixed enemy archetypes.
- Late game: demand adaptation and resource discipline.

## Boss Design Structure
- Intro phase: readable signature moves.
- Escalation phase: pattern permutations.
- Climax phase: risk-heavy punish windows.
- Recovery windows to prevent pure attrition fatigue.

## Build and Upgrade Strategy
- Reward mastery with expression options, not only raw power.
- Keep mobility and defense upgrades competitive with damage upgrades.

## Deliverables
- Combat verb list.
- Enemy archetype chart.
- Boss phase sheet.
- Difficulty target table.
- Upgrade economy mapping.

## Practical Checklist
- Are telegraphs readable at target framerate and camera distance?
- Does each failure teach an actionable correction?
- Are mobility and defensive options viable throughout progression?
