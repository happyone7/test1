# Strategy Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver planning depth through information management, long-horizon decisions, and meaningful systemic counterplay.

## Subgenre Split
- RTS: real-time pressure and multitasking skill.
- 4X: expansion, exploitation, diplomacy, and empire optimization.
- Tower Defense: lane control, placement strategy, and scaling response.

## Core Loop
1. Gather and allocate resources.
2. Expand capability through tech or unit development.
3. Scout and infer opponent state.
4. Commit strategic action.
5. Reassess and adapt.

## Systems Priorities
- Resource economy clarity.
- Tech tree pacing and branch viability.
- Unit or structure role identity.
- Counter system readability.

## Information Design
- Keep strategic data visible and queryable.
- Distinguish known information from fog-of-war assumptions.
- Use minimap and alerts as decision amplifiers, not noise.

## AI Planning
- Define AI behavior goals by game phase.
- Prevent AI from reading hidden information unfairly.
- Use difficulty via strategy sophistication, not stat inflation only.

## Difficulty and Skill Growth
- Teach economy fundamentals early.
- Introduce tactical complexity in controlled layers.
- Reward planning quality, not click speed alone.

## Deliverables
- Resource economy map.
- Tech tree and unlock pacing sheet.
- Counter matrix.
- AI behavior design brief.
- Scenario and campaign difficulty sheet.

## Practical Checklist
- Are multiple strategic archetypes viable at equal skill?
- Can players infer why they lost from visible information?
- Does late game preserve strategic agency?
