# Simulation Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver expressive systems where players create self-directed stories through management, optimization, and experimentation.

## Core Loop
1. Observe system state.
2. Make management decision.
3. Advance time and process consequences.
4. Adapt based on emergent outcomes.
5. Expand or specialize systems.

## Simulation Pillars
- Coherent systemic rules.
- Visible cause and effect.
- Layered optimization depth.
- Player-authored goals within guided framework.

## Economy and Resource Flow
- Define source/sink loops per subsystem.
- Prevent runaway positive feedback from dominating.
- Introduce constraints that create meaningful planning.

## Time and Pace Control
- Real-time with pause or variable speed options.
- Ensure high-speed modes preserve readability.
- Use event interruptions for critical decision moments.

## Sandbox vs Directed Progression
- Sandbox mode emphasizes creativity and ownership.
- Directed mode provides milestone guidance and achievement hooks.
- Support both where feasible to widen audience fit.

## Content Scaling
- Expand complexity through subsystem interactions.
- Avoid adding systems that are independent and non-interacting.
- Keep late-game maintenance burden manageable.

## Deliverables
- System interaction map.
- Resource loop schema.
- Time-scale tuning rules.
- Failure mode catalog.
- Progression milestone framework.

## Practical Checklist
- Can players explain why system outcomes occurred?
- Are optimal strategies varied rather than singular?
- Does complexity grow without overwhelming readability?
