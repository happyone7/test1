# SNG Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver short, repeatable social loops that reward routine play and friend-network interaction.

## Core Loop
1. Start short session.
2. Perform resource actions.
3. Trigger social interaction (visit, gift, request).
4. Set timers and asynchronous tasks.
5. Return for completion and rewards.

## Social System Architecture
- Friend visit incentives.
- Gifting reciprocity loops.
- Cooperative progression milestones.
- Group identity via guild/clan structures.

## Retention Model
- D1 hook: immediate progress and social invite trigger.
- D7 hook: layered tasks and social accountability.
- D30 hook: collections, events, and seasonal progression.

## Time-Gate and Cadence Design
- Use timer friction to create return moments, not punishment.
- Offer meaningful choices during wait windows.
- Avoid excessive notification pressure.

## Economy Considerations
- Balance free earnings against premium speed-up options.
- Keep social actions valuable but not mandatory for viability.
- Limit inflation from compounding social rewards.

## Event Strategy
- Weekly recurring event for habit formation.
- Monthly thematic event for novelty.
- Cooperative limited-time goals for network reactivation.

## Deliverables
- Daily loop map.
- Social feature matrix.
- Time-gate tuning sheet.
- Event calendar framework.
- Retention KPI dashboard specification.

## Practical Checklist
- Can players enjoy meaningful progress in under 5 minutes?
- Is social participation rewarding without becoming coercive?
- Are notifications opt-in and behaviorally respectful?
