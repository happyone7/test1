# Survival Horror Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver sustained tension through vulnerability, uncertainty, and controlled release moments.

## Core Loop
1. Explore hostile environment.
2. Gather scarce resources.
3. Avoid or survive threats.
4. Resolve objective under pressure.
5. Enter temporary relief before next escalation.

## Fear Design Pillars
- Anticipation is stronger than constant threat visibility.
- Sound and lighting carry emotional authority.
- Resource scarcity amplifies decision stakes.
- Safe moments must exist to reset player baseline.

## Resource Economy
- Ammo, healing, and tools should force tradeoffs.
- Scarcity should be legible, not random punishment.
- Crafting systems must preserve dread, not over-empower.

## Encounter Planning
- Use enemy unpredictability carefully; preserve fairness cues.
- Alternate stealth, chase, and confrontation pacing.
- Avoid repetitive jump-scare cadence.

## Narrative and Environmental Storytelling
- Use environment clues to build dread history.
- Keep exposition concise and context-driven.
- Align monster logic with world rules.

## UX Considerations
- Maintain readable objective guidance under darkness.
- Keep inventory interactions fast enough for panic contexts.
- Respect accessibility settings for audio and motion sensitivity.

## Deliverables
- Tension pacing chart.
- Resource scarcity model.
- Encounter type distribution map.
- Horror audio direction notes.
- Narrative dread checklist.

## Practical Checklist
- Is tension sustainable across full session length?
- Do players feel vulnerable but not powerless?
- Are scares varied in type and timing?
