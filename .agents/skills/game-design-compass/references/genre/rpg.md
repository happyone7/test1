# RPG Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver long-term character ownership through growth, build expression, and world-driven progression.

## Subgenre Split
- MMORPG: social persistence, economy depth, long-term class identity.
- ARPG: high-action combat loops, loot chase, build optimization.
- TRPG/SRPG: strategic turns, encounter planning, deterministic mastery.

## Core Loop Framework
1. Accept objective.
2. Explore or engage encounter.
3. Gain XP, resources, and loot.
4. Upgrade build and unlock capability.
5. Attempt higher challenge content.

## Progression Architecture
- Vertical progression: level, item power, skill rank.
- Horizontal progression: build diversity, utility unlocks, class expression.
- Meta progression: account-level unlocks, reputation, crafting mastery.

## Economy and Itemization
- Ensure each item tier has purpose and clear upgrade fantasy.
- Define rarity curves and drop pacing before content scaling.
- Include item sinks to avoid inflation and stale inventories.

## Quest and Narrative Integration
- Main quest defines world stakes.
- Side quests reinforce lore, economy, and build experimentation.
- Class quests deepen role identity.

## Encounter and Build Balance
- Avoid one-build dominance by preserving counterplay and role diversity.
- Tune damage spikes against survivability growth at each tier.
- Use expected TTK bands by content tier.

## Social and Retention Hooks
- Guild/group content scheduling.
- Cooperative goals and seasonal resets.
- Predictable cadence for endgame updates.

## Deliverables
- Class design matrix.
- Progression curve sheet.
- Loot table specification.
- Quest taxonomy and reward map.
- Endgame retention plan.

## Practical Checklist
- Are at least three viable builds per class supported?
- Is progression pace satisfying for both casual and high-engagement players?
- Does loot progression align with content difficulty?
