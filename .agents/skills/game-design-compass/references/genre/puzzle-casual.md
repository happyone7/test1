# Puzzle and Casual Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver approachable mastery through clear rules, rapid readability, and smooth challenge escalation.

## Core Loop
1. Present solvable challenge.
2. Player tests pattern or hypothesis.
3. Resolve success/failure quickly.
4. Grant reward and progression marker.
5. Introduce slight variation or new constraint.

## Difficulty Curve Framework
- Early: establish one mechanic per level.
- Mid: combine known mechanics in novel layouts.
- Late: introduce constraints that force strategic sequencing.

## Session Design
- Fast start and short loop completion.
- Frictionless retries.
- Gentle failure handling to preserve flow.

## Assistance Systems
- Hint design with escalating specificity.
- Booster tools as optional recovery, not required path.
- Energy system pacing for return rhythm.

## Accessibility
- Colorblind-safe puzzle signaling.
- Pattern differentiation beyond color.
- Clear iconography and shape language.

## Meta Progression
- Star ratings or chapter milestones.
- Cosmetic or thematic unlocks.
- Event stages for periodic novelty.

## Deliverables
- Level taxonomy by mechanic.
- Difficulty progression chart.
- Hint and booster policy.
- Session KPI targets.
- Accessibility test checklist.

## Practical Checklist
- Is each level objective understandable in under 5 seconds?
- Are failures perceived as fair and recoverable?
- Is monetization additive rather than punitive?
