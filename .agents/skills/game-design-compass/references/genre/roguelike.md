# Roguelike and Roguelite Design Reference

## Genre Promise
Deliver high-replay challenge loops where each run feels distinct and player learning compounds over time.

## Core Loop
1. Start run with constrained baseline kit.
2. Explore procedurally arranged spaces.
3. Make high-impact risk/reward choices.
4. Gain temporary run power and permanent meta progress.
5. Lose run and restart with improved knowledge or unlocks.

## Structural Pillars
- Procedural variation with readable logic.
- Build synergy discovery.
- Fair death learning.
- Tension between short-term survival and long-term optimization.

## Procedural Generation Rules
- Randomness should produce variety, not incoherence.
- Use weighted pools and biome constraints.
- Guarantee minimum viability paths for run completion.

## Meta Progression Design
- Roguelike focus: minimal external power, high mastery dependence.
- Roguelite focus: meaningful account progression and unlocks.
- Balance persistent growth so challenge identity remains intact.

## Item and Synergy Design
- Define item tags and interaction matrix.
- Encourage discovery through combinatorial effects.
- Cap degenerate infinite loops that trivialize content.

## Run Pacing
- Early floor: establish build direction quickly.
- Mid floors: force adaptation to scarcity and variation.
- Final floors: require execution and strategic commitment.

## Deliverables
- Procedural content rulebook.
- Item synergy matrix.
- Meta progression table.
- Run pacing target sheet.
- Death analytics instrumentation plan.

## Practical Checklist
- Does each run offer at least one meaningful strategic fork?
- Are deaths perceived as learnable, not arbitrary?
- Is meta progression rewarding without erasing challenge?
