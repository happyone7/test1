# Sprint 1 Audio Bootstrap

This folder contains bootstrap tooling for Sprint 1 sound start.

## Generate Placeholder Audio

```bash
python3 Tools/audio-stack/generate_sprint1_placeholder_audio.py
```

Generated outputs:
- Runtime load path: `Assets/Resources/Audio/...`
- Production mirror path: `Assets/Audio/...`

## Why placeholders?

- Sprint 1 goal is to unblock implementation and event timing checks.
- These clips are temporary and should be replaced by AI-produced final assets.

## Replacement tracking

- Manifest: `Assets/Audio/Sprint1_SoundManifest.csv`
